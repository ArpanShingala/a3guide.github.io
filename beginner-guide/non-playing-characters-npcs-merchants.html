<h4>Healer Merchant</h4>

feed, larcs and Shue resurrection potion.</p>
<br>
<h6>Selling Items</h6>

are those potions which increase the attack of the player for a fixed period of time. Larcs

<p><span>Note:</span> Shue resurrection potion should be used on an inactive shue.</p>
<h4>Identifier</h4>
<p>Identifiers are those NPCs who identify unidentified items apart from selling rings,
necklaces and shues.</p>
<br>
<h6>Selling Items</h6>
<p>Players can sell weapons and armors after getting them identified here besides selling
other crafting and reloading stuff. The NPC will give you 10% of the item cost in woonz.
So, as described earlier it is advisable to sell items to other players to fetch more wz.
 We can even sell our shues to this merchant. However lottery tickets and Quest items
cannot be sold.</p>
<h6>Buying Items</h6>
<p>Players can buy armor parts, eggs, rings and necklaces by clicking on the <span>Open NPC
window</span>. There are three tabs in Buy/Sell items each denoting different items. The
first tab shows the armor parts, second tab shows eggs and third tab shows rings and
necklaces. Players can identify a single item by clicking on <span>Identify Item</span> and hovering
it over to the unidentified item and clicking on it. A nominal charge of 100 wz will
be collected for identifying an item. Players can even use <span>Identify all items</span> which
in turn will identify all the unidentified items in the inventory. Players can purchase
eggs from this merchant by going to the second tab and clicking on the type of egg they
need. More information about shues can be found in our Beginner Guide section. Rings
and necklaces can be bought from the third tab. Players can only wear those rings and
necklaces if they meet the level requirements of the particular rings and necklaces.</p>
<h6>Breeding Shues</h6>
<p>Players can make a Super Shue by breeding two 100 level shues. A Super Shue is the
result of breeding 2 shues. The newly bred Super Shue will have both the parents'
options and will have an additional option for "Critical attack". It is possible to breed
2 shues of different classes into a super shue of either of the parents' class. To breed a
Super Shue, the 2 parent shues have to be of level 100. An Item Identifier NPC can breed
your 2 level 100 shues into a Super Shue. A Super Shue will start from level 1 again after
being bred. There is no level requirement to equip a Super Shue.</p>

<br>
<h4>Teleporter</h4>
<p>A teleporter/warp merchant is the one who Warps/transfers the player from one town
/ region to another for a fee. The teleporter NPC is the glowing one in the centre of the
town. For a fee you can instantly teleport to the map of your choice. You will arrive at
the connecting point of the map.</p>
<br>
<p>The fee is calculated depending on the characters level</p>
<p><span>Fee = (Level x 50) + 200 Wz</span></p>
<br>
<div class="hover" align="center"><span><img src="../images/articles/teleporternpc.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></span></div>
<br>
<h4>Storage Manager</h4>
<p>It is impossible for a player to carry all items in his inventory. This is where the storage
merchant comes handy. Players can enter the town storage by clicking on the <span>Open
NPC Window</span> from a storage merchant. In the store there are two tabs one where you
can put your items and the second tab allows you to deposit/withdraw woonz.</p>
<p>Each time you use the storage to take out or put in an item you are charged <span>500 WZ</span>.
Items are transferred by left-clicking the item and the destination.</p>

<br>
<div class="hover" align="center"><span><img src="../images/articles/storagenpc2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></span></div>
<br>
<h4>Hideout Manager</h4>
<p>Once you become the winner of the in-game Knighthood tournament as the overall
Sovereign, ownership of the castle will belong to you along with Tax collected in the
nation. The Castle Keeper allows access into the Castle and is also the person to receive
the taxes collected.</p>
<p>Additionally the Hideout Manager also carries out Hideout Auction so that Knighthood
Leaders could bid on Winning a Hideout for their Knighthood.</p>
<br>
<div class="hover" align="center"><span><img src="../images/articles/hideoutnpc.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></span></div>
<br>
<h4>Arena Manager</h4>
<p>The Arena Managers basically allow you to access the in-game PK Arena. An arena
where you can create maps to PK with other players, without the penalties of death or
parole time, which there will otherwise be, should you PK out of arena.</p>
<p>Managers of both towns will bring you to the same Arena no matter which town you
are accessing from. The Arena Manager also refreshes your HP/MP when you leave the
arena.</p>
<br>
<div class="hover" align="center"><span><img src="../images/articles/arenanpc.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></span></div>
<br>
<h4>Mercenary / Lottery Merchant</h4>
<p>Want to make it big with money? A millionaire overnight? The Lottery Selling NPC will
be the person to look for then! Purchase lottery tickets from these NPCs and see if you
are the lucky person at the end of the day / week to become instantly rich!</p>
<p>The frequency of the lottery draws may vary from a weekly to a daily event. (Though it
is mostly a daily event)</p>
<br>
<div class="hover" align="center"><span><img src="../images/articles/mercenarynpc.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></span></div>
<p>These merchants also sell mercenaries and are the only one who can revive your dead
mercenaries. Players of level 30 and above can buy mercenaries from this merchant.
When a player dies, his active mercenary also dies with the master. Players have to
revive their mercenaries using this merchant. More about Mercenaries could be found in the Advanced Guide.</p>
